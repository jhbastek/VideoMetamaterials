## Introduction & Setup
We introduce a framework to create mechanical metamaterials with a given nonlinear stress-strain response via video denoising diffusion as described in [Inverse design of nonlinear mechanical metamaterials via video denoising diffusion models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00762-x).

This code is based on the video denoising diffusion implementation by [Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains/imagen-pytorch) proposed in [Imagen Video](https://imagen.research.google/video/).

To conduct similar studies as those presented in the publication, start by cloning this repository via
```
git clone https://github.com/jhbastek/VideoMetamaterials.git
```

Next, download the data and model checkpoints provided in the [ETHZ Research Collection](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000629716). Unzip the training data `lagrangian.zip` in the `data` folder and the pre-trained model `pretrained.zip` in the `runs` folder, as shown below. Note that `eulerian.zip` must only be provided when training the model in the Eulerian frame, which was only used in preliminary studies.
```
.
├── data
│   ├── target_responses.csv
│   └── lagrangian
│   │   └── ...
│   └── eulerian (optional)
│       └── ...
└── runs
    └── pretrained
        └── ...
```

We use the [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) library to speed up training when a multi GPU environment is available. Please first configure your setup via `accelerate config` (note that `accelerate` can also be used in single GPU/CPU setups).

To generate new metamaterial samples conditioned on the four stress-strain responses shown in the publication simply run
```
accelerate launch main.py
```
The generated samples will then be stored in `runs/pretrained/eval_target_w_<guidance_weight>/` and should perform similar to the presented samples. We arrange all generated samples in a single grid, in which the row corresponds to row of `data/target_responses.csv`.   

To condition the denoising process on your own stress-strain responses, simply adjust `data/target_responses.csv` accordingly. Sample generation takes around 1 minute on a single Nvidia Quadro RTX 6000. In case of interest, we store the normalization constants to rescale the pixel values to their physical equivalent in `data/<reference_frame>/training/min_max_values.csv`.

To experiment with different setups simply change the user input in `main.py`. Here you can adjust the number of generated samples per conditioning, change the guidance scaling `w` or also train denoising models from scratch based on the hyperparameters defined in `model.yaml` (including the option to log to [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai)).

For further information, please first refer to the [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00762-x), the [Supplementary Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00762-x#Sec18) or reach out to [Jan-Hendrik Bastek](mailto:jbastek@ethz.ch).

## FEM evaluation via Abaqus

We also provide the scripts to evaluate the generated designs via Abaqus CAE 2020. For this, run `eval_abaqus.py` with the path to the predicted samples that should contain a `geometries.csv` file with the binary pixel predictions. Predictions are stored in row-wise order in this file, and you must provide the `sample_index` corresponding to the row you want to evaluate. Note that `eval_abaqus.py` is a wrapper that will call `abaqus cae`, therefore make sure that you can run Abaqus from the command line. Functionality was verified on Microsoft Windows 10 OS. As mentioned in the publication, we have typically generated 10 samples and provided the best match. Similarly, more samples are likely necessary to obtain a good match for highly exotic stress-strain responses, while a single sample may suffice for simpler curves (such as the one presented in Fig. 3a of the publication).

## Visualization

Lastly, run `gif_visualization.py` to convert the raw gifs (either sampled from the diffusion model or generated via Abaqus) into a similar format as given in the paper. Further details are given in the script.

## Dependencies

The framework was developed and tested on Python 3.11 using CUDA 12.0 and requires the following Python packages.
Package | Version (>=)
